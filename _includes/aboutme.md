I'm a first-year PhD student at Northeastern University. I work on the security of distributed systems, specifically blockchains and distributed ledgers.

I am part of the [Network and Distributed Systems Security Lab](https://nds2.ccs.neu.edu/) and work with [Cristina Nita-Rotaru](http://cnitarot.github.io).

I did my undergrad at NUST School of EE & CS, Islamabad, Pakistan.
